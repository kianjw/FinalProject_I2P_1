## Project Overview

The **Flappy Bird** game is designed with the bird fixed on the x-axis and moving along the y-axis. To simplify implementation, pipes move from right to left.  

### Additional Features:
- Randomized pipe lengths and positions.
- Game-ending events when collisions occur.  

### Assets Source:
- [ianitow/flappy-bird-game (GitHub)](https://github.com/ianitow/flappy-bird-game/tree/main/images)

## Features

1. **Persistent High Score**:
   - The highest score is saved locally in a file and loaded when the game restarts.
   - If a new high score is achieved, the file updates automatically.

2. **Error Handling with `must_init`**:
   - Ensures the program halts with an error message if a critical operation fails, minimizing user-side issues.

3. **Buffered Graphics Rendering**:
   - Double buffering prevents graphical glitches and improves performance.

## Customization Options

1. **Screen Scaling**: Adjust screen size by modifying **line 68**.
2. **Pipe Gap**: Change the gap size between pipes at **line 383**.
3. **Score Unit**: Update the scoring system at **line 433**.
4. **Character Properties** (Not Recommended): Modify character settings between **lines 369-373**.
